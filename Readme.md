# 📘 End-to-End DevOps Platform – Project Documentation

## 📌 Overview
This repository is the **central documentation and control hub** for an end-to-end DevOps project built using **multiple repositories** and **enterprise-style practices**.

The project demonstrates:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Centralized CI/CD using Jenkins
- Infrastructure as Code and deployments
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Slack-based approvals and notifications
- Disaster Recovery (DR) readiness
- One-command start/stop of the entire platform

> **Core idea:**  
> Application code, pipelines, infrastructure, monitoring, and documentation are decoupled but unified through a controlled and auditable workflow.
